# kicad_libs used by microkeys

A collection of footprints, symbols, and 3D models for building mechanical keyboards with Kicad.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microkeys/kicad_libs.git
```

1. Add a `MICROKEYS_LIBS` path to match where the `kicad_libs` folder is located.

2. Add the symbol library from `${MICROKEYS_LIBS}/symbols/`

3. Add the footprint libraries from `${MICROKEYS_LIBS}/footprints/`
